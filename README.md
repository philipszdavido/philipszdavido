## 🚀 Featured Projects

- **[Ardan Programming Language](https://github.com/ardan-lang)**
Ardan is an experimental, dynamically typed programming language inspired by JavaScript, featuring a hand-written lexer, parser, and interpreter implemented in C++. Ardan supports variables, functions, classes, inheritance, arrays, objects, control flow, and modern syntax features such as let/const/var, scoping, and operator overloading.

 Key Features 
Dynamic Typing: Types are determined at runtime. 
Block & Lexical Scope: Supports var, let, and const with scoping rules. 
First-Class Functions: Functions can be assigned, passed, and returned. 
Classes & Inheritance: ES6-style classes, constructors, inheritance via extends. 
Rich Expressions: Arithmetic, logical, bitwise, assignment, and comparison operators. 
Arrays & Objects: Flexible syntax and semantics. 
Exception Handling: try, catch, finally, and throw. 
Extensible: Add new built-ins and modules in C++.

Tools and Tech: C++, Xcode, C++20, Cocoa, Linux Server, Win32 API.

- 💰 **[NetWorth Tracker](https://github.com/philipszdavido/networt)** (SwiftUI)  
  Track bank balances and total net worth. Add/remove transactions, manage multiple accounts, and view financial history in a clean iOS interface.

- 📺 **[Understanding Dev App](https://github.com/philipszdavido/UnderstandingDevChannel)** (SwiftUI)  
  A native iOS app for my YouTube channel. Displays videos, playlists, and includes customizable settings – built with MVVM and modern SwiftUI.

- 🧭 **[Browser-SwiftUI](https://github.com/philipszdavido/Browser-SwiftUI)**
Browser-SwiftUI is a lightweight HTML rendering engine built entirely in SwiftUI. It takes an HTML string and dynamically parses and renders it using native SwiftUI views — no WebKit, no WKWebView, just pure SwiftUI.

- 🧩 **[HTMLParser](https://github.com/philipszdavido/HTMLParser)**
**HTMLParser** is a lightweight HTML parsing engine written entirely in **Swift**. It converts raw HTML strings into a structured tree of tokens and nodes, making it ideal for building custom renderers (like `Browser-SwiftUI`) without relying on WebKit.

  A lightweight HTML parser written entirely in C++ — no external dependencies. Designed for speed, clarity, and flexibility, this parser can tokenize and extract HTML elements, attributes, and text content for further processing.


- ⚡ **[POSTly](https://post-ly.github.io/)** (React + Node)  
  A browser-based REST API tester for developers. Lightweight, fast, and ideal for debugging endpoints without switching tools.

- 🧱 **[Course Platform](https://onlinecoursehost.com/) (Full Stack)**  
  Built and led a course SaaS platform with content drip scheduling, page builder, Firestore data models, and AWS-integrated media delivery.
